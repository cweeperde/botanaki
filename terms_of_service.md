**Last Updated:** 15.10.2024

## 1. Introduction  
Welcome to botanaki! These Terms of Service ("ToS") govern your use of the botanaki Discord bot, which provides utility and moderation features for servers. By using botanaki, you agree to comply with these terms. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the bot.

## 2. Purpose of the Bot  
Botanaki is designed to assist with server moderation and provide various utility features. It allows server owners to automate tasks, manage user roles, and moderate offensive language (if enabled).

## 3. User Eligibility  
There are no restrictions on who can use botanaki. The bot is accessible to all users within Discord servers where it has been added.

## 4. Data Collection  
Botanaki collects certain user and server data necessary for moderation and utility functions. This includes:
- User IDs
- Server IDs
- Channel IDs  

This data is used to moderate channels, manage user roles, and save server-specific settings. **Botanaki does not store any user messages**, even if offensive language moderation is enabled.

## 5. User Content  
When offensive language moderation is enabled, botanaki will scan messages in real time for inappropriate content. However, no messages are stored or saved by the bot.

## 6. Usage Restrictions  
To ensure a positive experience for all users, the following actions are prohibited:
- Abusing any APIs integrated into botanaki
- Spamming commands excessively
- Engaging in behavior that disrupts the normal use of the bot

Botanaki may suspend its functionalities for users or servers that engage in such activities.

## 7. Monetization  
Botanaki does not offer any paid features or services. All functionalities are available for free, and there will be no future paid upgrades.

## 8. Liability  
Botanaki is provided on an "as-is" basis. While we strive to keep the bot running smoothly, there is no guarantee of availability or functionality. **cweeper** (Discord Bot Owner Username) will not be liable for any loss, damage, or inconvenience resulting from the use or inability to use botanaki.

## 9. Availability  
While botanaki aims to provide 24/7 uptime, its availability depends on server and hosting resources. There is no guaranteed uptime, and the bot may experience downtime due to maintenance or other issues.

## 10. Updates and Changes  
The ToS may be updated from time to time. It is the userâ€™s responsibility to check the latest version of the ToS. No direct notifications will be sent regarding updates; the latest version will always be available within this document.

## 11. Jurisdiction  
No specific jurisdiction governs these Terms of Service. The bot is offered globally without adherence to any specific regional laws.

## 12. Termination of Access  
No user will be banned or restricted from using botanaki. However, server owners may remove the bot at their discretion. The bot owner might also manually remove the bot from any servers if required.
