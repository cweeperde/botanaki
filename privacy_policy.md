# Botanaki - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 15.10.2024

## 1. Data Collected  
Botanaki collects and stores the following data:
- User IDs
- Server IDs
- Channel IDs
- Server-specific settings (which may include specified names set by users)  

No additional data is collected beyond what is necessary for the bot’s functions. No user messages or content are stored.

## 2. Data Usage  
The data collected by botanaki is solely used for the following purposes:
- Moderation of Discord servers
- Server logging
- Managing and saving server-specific settings  

If the data is lost or removed, it will simply reset the bot’s configuration, without any critical data being lost.

## 3. Data Sharing  
Botanaki does not share any collected data with third parties. The bot may interact with external APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), but no sensitive data is submitted without explicit knowledge of the users.

## 4. Data Retention  
Data is stored indefinitely but may be deleted occasionally for maintenance or bug fixes. If the bot is removed from a server, all data related to that server will be automatically deleted. If the bot is offline during the removal, the data will be deleted on its next boot.

## 5. Data Security  
The bot operates within a secure hosting environment, and external access to the data is highly restricted. We take reasonable precautions to protect the data stored by botanaki.

## 6. User Rights  
Due to the nature of the data stored, users cannot request access to their stored data, as it may contain sensitive server-specific information, such as hidden channels or restricted settings.

## 7. Cookies and Tracking  
Botanaki does not use cookies or any other form of tracking technology.

## 8. Changes to the Privacy Policy  
Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be reflected within this document. Users are responsible for staying informed about updates.

## 9. Contact Information
